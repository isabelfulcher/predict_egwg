# Overview
This repository contains code for data processing, model development, and model evaluation corresponding to the "Using gestational weight gain trajectories to predict excessive gestational weight gain" manuscript. 

# Caveats
1. This repository does **not** contain any raw or processed data from the [Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b)](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/nuMoM2b) study. This information is available from [NICHD DASH](https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/). All of our analyses used the "nuMoM2b_Merged_Dataset.csv" available in the bulk download from NICHD DASH website, which is a combination of multiple datasets compiled in the study. 
2. The validation study data is not publicly available nor by request due to constraints from the originating institution. As such, no data or metadata from this dataset is available in this repository.
